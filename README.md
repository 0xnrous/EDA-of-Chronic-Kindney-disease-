This proposed work aims to develop a CKD (chronic kidney disease) identification system. The project involves two main steps: data preprocessing and data visualization.

In the data preprocessing step, the focus is on handling missing values, specifically removing NaN values from the dataset. This is a crucial step to ensure the data is clean and ready for further analysis.

The second step involves data visualization techniques to enhance the statistical analysis of the dataset. By creating visual representations of the data, patterns, trends, and correlations can be easily identified. This step is essential for gaining insights into the dataset and improving the understanding of the factors associated with CKD.

By combining data preprocessing and visualization techniques, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, facilitating the identification and understanding of CKD. The results and insights obtained from this work can contribute to the development of effective strategies for diagnosing and managing CKD in the medical field.
